# Seven Arts Travel – Frontend

**Seven Arts Travel** is an application that aims to become a cultural travel guide. It is designed for those who wish
to discover the richness of cultural diversity through traveling. The seven arts — **Architecture, Sculpture, Painting,
Literature, Cinema, Music, Ballet and Theater** — are the focus of this project.

This application provides the user interface for exploring places and events related to the arts, such as
historical buildings, museums, art galleries, libraries, exhibitions, performances, festivals, and more.

## Project Overview

This is the **client-side (frontend)** application for
the [Seven Arts Travel — Backend](https://github.com/CarinaPorumb/seven-arts-travel).

It is built using **React** and **Vite**, and it will provides the user interface for exploring and interacting with
art-related data served by the backend API.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Styling is intentionally minimal at this stage — structure first, design later.

- The [Seven Arts Travel — Backend](https://github.com/CarinaPorumb/seven-arts-travel) is currently under active
  development as part of a migration from a monolithic MVC app to a modern REST + SPA, and may occasionally return
  errors
  or behave inconsistently.

## Tech Stack
