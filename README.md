# Seven Arts Travel – Frontend

This is the **client-side (frontend)** application for the
project [Seven Arts Travel — API](https://github.com/CarinaPorumb/seven-arts-travel).

It is built using **React** and **Vite**, and it will provide the user interface for exploring and interacting with
art-related data served by the backend API.

## 📝 Notes

- Styling is intentionally minimal at this stage — structure first, design later.

- The [Seven Arts Travel — API](https://github.com/CarinaPorumb/seven-arts-travel) is currently being updated and may
  temporarily return errors or behave inconsistently.

- This frontend is under active development as part of a migration from a monolithic MVC app to a modern REST + SPA
  stack.
